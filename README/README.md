# HTML-CSS-Challenge-Code-Refractoring-Horiseon

The HTML-CSS coding challenge for Week One focused on refractoring both the HTML and CSS file. Adding HTML Scemantic Elements and consolidating the CSS code, removing duplicate code and combining classes, and the code was reorganized to reflect the order of the elements in the index file. Div tags were replaced with Section and Nav tags. Links were fixed that were missing the Id tags. The Alt atrribute was added to the image elements.
